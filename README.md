# Interactive Monte Carlo π Approximation

This project is an interactive Python visualization that approximates the value of π (pi) using the **Monte Carlo method**. Random points are generated inside a square, and the fraction that fall inside an inscribed circle is used to estimate π.

The simulation updates dynamically as the number of random points changes, allowing you to visually and numerically observe how the approximation improves with larger sample sizes.

## 📐 How the Monte Carlo Method Approximates π

A circle of radius 1 is inscribed inside a square of side length 2.

* Area of circle: πr² = π
* Area of square: (2r)² = 4

This gives the relationship:

**π ≈ 4 × (points inside circle / total points)**

As more random points are sampled, the ratio converges toward the true value of π.
